Scripts for RPGVXAce

scripts.rb
----------

Copied and pasted half the header comment from scripts.rb

This script imports and exports scripts to and from the Scripts.rvdata2 file in a RPGVXAce project.

Recommended if you want to:
 * do projects that involve heavy coding
 * use version control
 * allow multiple scripters to work concurrently
 * work in your own text editor
